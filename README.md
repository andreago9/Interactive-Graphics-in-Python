# Interactive Graphics in Python
Genetic and Metabolite Visualization

## 1. About
This Jupyter Notebook showcases a series of interactive data visualizations developed in Python. The notebook focuses on illustrating the relationships between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and metabolite concentrations using fictional data. The visualizations are built using libraries such as matplotlib, plotly, and ipywidgets, allowing for dynamic exploration of genetic data.

Key components of this notebook include:

>**Interactive Scatter Plots:** Visualizations showing the correlation between individual SNPs and metabolite concentrations.
>
>**3D Surface Plot:** A 3D plot demonstrating how two different SNPs influence the concentration of a specific metabolite.
>
>**User Interaction:** Implementation of interactive widgets that allow users to select different SNPs, adjust concentration factors, and observe the resulting changes in real-time.
  

## Source

The simulations presented are purely fictional examples inspired by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on metabolic traits and **do not represent real study data**. The paper, titled Genome-Wide Association Study of Metabolic Traits Reveals Novel Gene-Metabolite-Disease Links, explores how certain genetic variations are linked to metabolic traits and their potential implications for diseases. The study, conducted by Rueedi et al. (2014), provides insights into novel gene-metabolite associations and their possible role in disease progression.

## Usage

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly
- ipywidgets

You can interact with the visualizations directly in the notebook, allowing for an exploratory analysis of the simulated genetic data.

This notebook demonstrates the power of interactive graphics in Python, particularly for applications in bioinformatics and genomics.
